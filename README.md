# Tata-forage-Gen-ai-internship-task2
This repository contains my submission for Task 2 of the Tata Data Analytics Virtual Internship 2025, focused on predictive modeling using the Geldium dataset. This task builds on insights from Task 1 (EDA) and applies GenAI-powered methods to design a responsible and explainable credit risk model.

# Context
-**generated model logic (either GenAI output or a paraphrased version)**
-**model justification — why you chose it and how it fits the task**
-**evaluation strategy, explaining how you would assess accuracy and fairness**

# Tools or platform used
-**GenAI tools like ChatGPT & Gemini (for logic generation and refinement)**
-**Prompt-driven modeling approach**
-**Microsoft Word – final plan drafted and formatted for submission**

### This is a conceptual exercise — you are not expected to write working code. Focus on explaining your thinking and showing how you used GenAI for support.
